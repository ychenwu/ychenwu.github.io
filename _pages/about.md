<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my website! My name is Yuchen Wu, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on surface and interface chemistry, polymer adhesives, thin-film deposition, and lithium batteries. I have over nine years of experience in materials formulation design and material characterization, as well as extensive hands-on experience working in cleanroom environments. A major highlight of my work is developing and applying advanced analytical tools to non-destructively probe surfaces and buried interfacesâ€”areas that are typically difficult to access.

I have collaborated with several companies to tackle real-world industrial challenges. A few recent accomplishments include:

1. In collaboration with BASF, I developed a rapid 2-minute inhibitor deposition method to form ODPA self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which are widely used in selective ALD. I also applied SFG spectroscopy to quantify the ODPA filmâ€™s coverage and quality.

2. I employed surface- and interface-sensitive techniques to support Dow and BASF in in-situ investigations of buried adhesive/substrate interfaces, providing molecular-level insights into how additives (e.g., adhesion promoters and fillers) and surface treatments enhance adhesion.

3. I worked with Ford to examine and optimize the formation and aging of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium batteries using ex-situ and operando SFG experiments, thereby improving SEI formation and enhancing lithium battery manufacturing efficiency.
