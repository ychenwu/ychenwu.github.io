Welcome to my website! My name is Yuchen Wu, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on surface and interface chemistry, polymer adhesives, thin-film deposition, and lithium batteries. I have over nine years of experience in materials formulation design and material characterization, as well as extensive hands-on experience working in cleanroom environments. A major highlight of my work is developing and applying advanced analytical tools to non-destructively probe surfaces and buried interfacesâ€”areas that are typically difficult to access. I have collaborated with several companies to tackle real-world industrial challenges. The projects I am working on are shown below.

[**Main Project**]
- Investigated the working mechanisms of additives (silica fillers, silanes) in high-temperature vulcanized (HTV) silicone adhesives. (Dow)
- Studied the environmental effects on the performance of room-temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone adhesives. (Dow)
- Developed a rapid 2-minute inhibitor deposition method to form ODPA self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on copper-coated wafers for selective ALD. (BASF)
- Explored the effects of plasma treatment and silane coupling agents on one-component (1K) and two-component (2K) polyurethane adhesives. (BASF)
- Examined the effects of surfactants and salts on the adsorption behavior of multiple proteins (antibodies, fouling proteins). (BASF)
- Elucidated the formation and aging of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the molecular level using commercial electrolyte formulations. (Ford)
- Unveiled the molecular-level adsorption of conjugated antigens onto adjuvants in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). (Merck)
